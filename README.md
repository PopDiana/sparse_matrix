 
  A python module for sparse two-dimensional arrays of real numbers.

The matrices' representation is done by storing only the non-zero values, specified by tuples <i, j, v>, where i and j are indices in the matrix corresponding to the non-zero value v. The module allows the following problems to be solved:
- Matrix creation;
- Matrix display;
- Determining the matrix size;
- Reading a value and writing it in the array (the element is specified by its indices);
- The operations of adding, subtracting and multiplying two matrices;
- Access to a matrix element by its indices;
- Creating a unit matrix;
- Creating a zero matrix;
- Transposing the matrix.
